# EcoMemes
Eco-related memes!!

To start running the streamlit website,

```
streamlit run main.py
```

The python libraries required for this project are:

```
pip install openai streamlit boto3
```

Since we've used ChatGPT's API and it uses a secret key, the key is invalidated everytime you clone the repo. Therefore, you will need to change the value of open.api_key on line five of main.py to:

```

```
