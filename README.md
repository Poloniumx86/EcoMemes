Eco-related memes!!

To start running the streamlit website,

```
streamlit run main.py
```

The python libraries required for this project are:

```
pip install openai streamlit boto3
```

Since we're using ChatGPT's API in some parts of our website, it requires an API key which will be removed by GitHub. Therefore, to run the code you'll need to provide your own API key in the following file and format:

**`.env`**
```
API_KEY=
```
